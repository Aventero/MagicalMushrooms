  - Oh you're really not intruding..
  - My name is Brigit...
  - You can stay here for a while if you'd like.
  - Like you mentioned.. it's way too cold out there.
  - The snow keeps piling up... I can't get it out of the way anymore.
  - But more importantly... you look tired.
  - It must have been difficult to come here.
  - Why don't you rest for a bit?
  - You can sit over here at the fireplace.
  - Try and warm yourself up...
  - I'm just over here carving some wood.
