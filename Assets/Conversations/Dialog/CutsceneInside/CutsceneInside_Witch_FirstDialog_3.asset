  - Oh you're really not intruding, my name is Brigit
  - U can stay here for a while if you'd like.
  - It's very cold outside at the moment
  - The snow keeps piling up...  it's a real pain.
  - But more importantly... you look very tired.
  - It must have been difficult to come here.
  - Why don't you rest for a bit?
  - U can sit over there at the fireplace.
  - U can warm up there.
