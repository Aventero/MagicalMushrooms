  conversation:
  - 'Oh no! You were shrinked by an evil witch.



    Make your way out of the witch
    house by finding a magical potion in each room. They will help you to grow back
    to your original size.'
  - "To open the door to the next room you need to find the potion, but there may
    be obstacles in your way. \r\n\r\nLook around closely for things to help you
    overcome these obstacles and keep an eye on the hints in the upper right corner."
  - Watch out for the witch, she will try to catch you - so be careful and hide when
    she comes closer.
