  conversation:
  - Oh no! You were shrinked by an evil witch.
  - "Make your way out of the witch house by finding a magical potion in each room.
    \n"
  - They will help you to grow back to your original size.
  - "To open the door to the next room you need to find the potion, but there may
    be obstacles in your way. \r\n\r"
  - Look around closely for things to help you overcome these obstacles and keep
    an eye on the hints in the upper right corner.
  - Watch out for the witch, she will try to catch you - so be careful and hide when
    she comes closer.
