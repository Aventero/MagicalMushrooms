  - Hey again!
  - Don't worry there isn't multiple versions of me....
  - I'm simply teleporting.
  - But more importantly....
  - Did you collect some magic?
  - U should see that you have some magic... or feel it maybe?
  - Oh no you can see it if you look at your staff... u know the weird liquid?
  - Yeah you can use that to cast magic and charge up things!
  - You see the big log over there?
  - Why don't you charge it full of magic...
  - Something will happen...
  - .... for sure!
