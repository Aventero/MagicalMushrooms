  - ...Wait!
  - You probably wanted to go into that light over there.
  - Make sure that you are never seen by this light..
  - Once she watches you too long.
  - She might put you in that cage again..
  - ... or I guess as long as you lit my candles you should be alright.
  - ... Probably.
  - But if you don't want to be seen by her..
  - You can use ur [SMOKE MAGIC]...
  - Try throwing it with [F]...
  - And hide in there from sight.
