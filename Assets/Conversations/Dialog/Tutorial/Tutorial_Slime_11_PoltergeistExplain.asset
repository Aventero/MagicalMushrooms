  - Hey..
  - Took you long enough to get here.
  - But more importantly...
  - 'She is back...... '
  - If you don't want to get caught again then stay hidden.
  - Also use [POLTERGEIST] to make her look away.
  - U can use it by pressing [R] and select something that you can shake.
  - On this table there is so many things you can move around.
  - Try it... but make sure you don't alert her in your direction...
  - Or mine.
