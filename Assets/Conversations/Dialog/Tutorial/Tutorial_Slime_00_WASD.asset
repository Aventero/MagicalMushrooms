  - ... Where am I?
  - ......
  - Is that a slime?..
  - ... with a hat.
  - Also.. I am in a cage?
  - Why am I even here...
  - I cannot seem to remember..
  - Atleast I can remember on how to move...
  - ... It was [W A S D] to walk if I can trust my legs.
  - Moving around a [MOUSE should turn around my head.
  - I guess I can try walking to the slime?
  - Maybe it can let me out of here..
