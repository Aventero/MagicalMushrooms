  - Howdy!
  - You want to know about the staff you are holding?
  - Well... I don't know either why you have it.
  - You simply woke up with it.
  - I felt a strong presence emitting from the staff..
  - Thats also the reason I found you when you woke up.
  - ....
  - Maybe you were also a magician before you became...
  - Well... whatever you are now.
  - But... hey... you're looking sharp.
  - In my opinion.. that is.

  - Anyway...
  - Bye bye!
