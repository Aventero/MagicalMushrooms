  - ....OH!
  - Oh wow.
  - I didn't think you would get here.
  - ...
  - Seems like you've gotten the hang of using the magic.
  - ... want to know a secret?
  - '.... '
  - Wait .. you don't?
  - Comon...
  - Alright ..  I will tell you.
  - I wasn't born as a slime..
  - But.. to be honest with you.. I'm not sure either who I was.
  - "I once heard her talk about me.. after I escaped and hid away.\t"
  - She talked to herself about how she changed up my matter.
  - So.. I guess I can thank her for making me all slimy and gooey.
  - Anyway.. that is not important.
  - Whats important is that you get out of here.
  - ... good luck.
  - ....
