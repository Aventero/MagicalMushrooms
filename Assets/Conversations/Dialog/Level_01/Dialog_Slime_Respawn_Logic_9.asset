  - Hi.
  - You seem confused.
  - ....
  - Why you are appearing at candles after you fall down?
  - Well it's just magic.
  - ....
  - Ok not satisfyed... I will try to explain.
  - 'This might sound a bit scary... '
  - .. but your body is not the same as it was.
  - Whenever you fall down into the fog.
  - Whenever you fall down into the pink fog...
  - Your body melts down.
  - But not your soul..
  - Your soul will travel to the brightest point it once knew.
  - And thats one of the candles which you lit with magic.
  - There your body is reconstructed.
  - So.... yeah.... I hope you're not scared now.
  - 'It''s all very safe... '
  - Have a good time!
