  - Hey.. again!
  - How have you been?
  - I must have been very difficult to cope with this situation.
  - It was hard for me at first aswell.
  - Suddenly you are like this.
  - Without any memories.
  - ...
  - The only thing you know of is...
  - That you must leave this place.
  - I don't even remember for how long I've been here...
  - I wish I could leave..
  - 'Enjoy my life again... '
  - But I'm stuck.
  - Forever.
  - .....
