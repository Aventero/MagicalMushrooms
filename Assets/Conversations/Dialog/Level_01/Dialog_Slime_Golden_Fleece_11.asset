  - Hi.
  - You found me again...
  - Wanna know more about mushrooms?
  - There are alot of different mushrooms around here.
  - You meant the yellow ones that make you stronger?
  - This type is called Golden Fleece!
  - The reason why they give you strength...
  - '... is caused by the way they grow. '
  - They are like sponges with endless capacity.
  - Meaning.. they suck up energy forever..
  - They simply grow bigger and bigger.
  - These here are still fairly small....
  - Thats why they only make you a little bit stronger...
  - .. after you ate them.
  - I hope that explains it.
  - See ya.
